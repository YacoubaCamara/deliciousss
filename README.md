App name: deliciousss

Built a fully responsive single-page application (SPA) in React, implementing dynamic recipe search, filtering, and
detail views with real-time Spoonacular API integration.
Managed application state and side effects using React hooks (useState, useEffect) to fetch and render external
data asynchronously.
Implemented client-side routing with React Router for navigation between search results, cuisine categories, and
individual recipe pages without page reloads.
